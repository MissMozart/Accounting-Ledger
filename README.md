# Accounting Ledger

This project is an accounting ledger written in Java which reads and writes transactions from and to a .csv file. The main class is called MainApp.java.
## Main menu options
- Add Deposit
- Make Payment
- Ledger

The ledger has its own menu.
## Ledger menu
- All Entries
- Deposits
- Payments
- Reports

The Reports have its own menu.
## Reports menu
- Current Month
- Last Month
- Current Year
- Last Year
- By Vendor

The transactions are always shown with the latest on top and the oldest on the bottom of the list. 

A limitation of the program is that it doesn't take String input when it asks for an amount. 

## Special part of code
A special part of my code is that the program asks if you want to make another payment or deposit before taking you back to the main menu.

## Thank you
to A'sha Shepard, Mohammed Ahmed, Cristi Savca and Javier Chavez for all the help they gave me.

Here are some example pictures of the code:
